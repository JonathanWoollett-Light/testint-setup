# testint-setup


With build scripts that allow the project to be built natively, we can choose to build it in a spereate system, docker or a VM(rather embedding dependencies into docker which then requires docker to build the project, this also allows better explicit illustration of dependencies per crate).

Could also possibly use something like https://crates.io/crates/system-deps
